# How Contract Works

### The Basics

It is a combination of a **lottery and a last buy competition**.\
the lottery here will happen randomly whenever someone wins the GuardPot or the burn feast happen. \
\
Five Random persons will be picked automatically by the contract who's buys are above the minimum buy and share **`30%`** of whatever is in the GuardPot equally to them and this happens automatically and so the team have no power over this but if it is a burn feast that happens, it is **`20% of the entire amount`** in there that is shared to them automatically.&#x20;

### &#x20;Lottery is meant to reward the pot keepers.

&#x20;The last buy competition is the last person to make a buy that is above the minimum buy and no other person buys up to the minimum amount again in **`5 minutes`** and therefore that person automatically gets **`30%`**\
of whatever is in the GuardPot while as said earlier, **`30%`** also is shared automatically to reward **`5 random attempters`** to win the pot or keep the pot.

* **`Minimum buy: 0.05bnb`**
* **`Timer: 5 minutes`**
* **`Burn feast: At 30bnb`**
* **`Guardpot win: Anytime`**
